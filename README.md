# autopilot
eve online autopilot for inner space

--

coded in 5min, tested in 10min and but I use it now for 5 hours now to fly around with freigthers.

Its just a first aid kit for a pilot who do not have to much time.

undock: `run autopilot` wait for the first mousemoment and then you have to leave the eve window and the script will use your mouse in the background and navigate you to the location.

It will not dock in the final destination.
